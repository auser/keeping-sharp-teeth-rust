# Keeping Sharp Teeth in Rust

A small repository for practicing Rust with one Cargo project per problem.

## Repository layout

- `problems/` contains the problem statements as Markdown files named
  `NNN_problem-name.md`.
- `answers/` contains the Rust binary crates created for those problems.
  Directory names keep the problem number, for example
  `003_palindrome_number.md` becomes `answers/003-palindrome-number/`. Cargo
  package names omit the numeric prefix (`palindrome-number`) because Cargo
  package names cannot start with a digit.

## Create an answer project

To create a project for the next problem that does not already have an answer
directory, run:

```sh
make answer
```

Problems are considered in numeric filename order. The command creates a
standard binary Cargo project in `answers/` and skips problems whose answer
directory already exists.

To choose a particular problem by its numeric prefix, run:

```sh
make answer PROBLEM=003
```

You can also pass the full problem filename stem:

```sh
make answer PROBLEM=003_palindrome_number
```

The explicit form selects a matching `problems/NNN_*.md` file and reports an
error if its answer project already exists.

## Work on an answer

Change into the generated project and use Cargo as usual:

```sh
cd answers/003-palindrome-number
cargo test
cargo run
```

Run `make help` to see the available Make targets. The project generator
requires Rust and Cargo to be installed.
